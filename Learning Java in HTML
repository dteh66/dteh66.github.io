     <h3> Classes </h3>
     In general, a <b>class</b> is a <i>template</i> used to create <b> objects </b>
     <br />
     Each object created by a template has <b> instance variables</b>, or data specific to each <i><u>instance</u></i>/object of 1 class <i> when it is first created </i>
     <ul>
     </ul>
     <br />
     <h4> Creating a class </h4>
     To create an object, you use a <b>constructor.</b> By executing a constructor, you will create an instance of a certain class
     <br />
     You can even customize the class object's instance variables with different <b>paramaters</b> when 'first creating a class / executing the constructor'
     <br />
     <br />
     
     <h3> Variables </h3>
     Variables are any sort of value or text that is stored in the computer's memory and can be (mostly) changed freely.
     <br />
     <li>     Different variable <i> types </i> include: <u> Integer, String, Double, Boolean, Array, </u> Byte, Long, Short, and possibly more </li>
     <h3> Methods </h3>
     There are (generally) 2 kinds of methods: <b>Setter</b> and <b>Getter</b> Methods
     <br />
     <br />
     To change the variables after the class is first created, you make <b> setter methods </b> in the class
     <br /> 
     When you call to use the method, you probably need to use <b> input parameters </b> in order to customize what the class's variable is being changed to
     <br />
     <br />
     A <b>getter method</b> in class A is used if class B wants to access something, maybe a <b>instance variable</b> from class A
     <br />
     
     <h3> Accessing information </h3>
     Each class can have instance variables, but you can limit whether or not other classes can access it
     <br />
     Say you don't want one class to access the information/variables of another class
     So, you simply put the keyword <b><u>private</u></b> (as apposed to <u>public</u>) before typing out the rest of the variable
